  CityZones Application Server is a web interface for the <a href="https://github.com/jpjust/cityzones-maps-service" target="_blank">Maps-service</a>,
  written by Ph.D candidate <a href="http://just.pro.br/" target="_blank">João Paulo Just Peixoto</a> under supervision of
  Prof. Daniel G. Costa, Ph.D (FEUP) and Prof. Washington de Jesus Sant'Anna da Franca Rocha, Ph.D (UEFS). This work was also supported by
  a research intership period at FEUP (Porto, Portugal), with supersion of Prof. Paulo Portugal, Ph.D.

  This web interface manages the interactions with the users when creating a polygonal AoI (Area of Interest) over any city, which is the geographical
  area to be considered when computing risk zones. Additionally, this web interface is also responsible to display the processed results according to a defined multi-tier architecture. 
  The computed zones are obtained according to a mathematical model based on the definition of <b>mitigation levels</b>, which are an indirect indication of how hard is to
  respond (mitigate) to an ongoing emergency after the occurence of a critical event. Each zone is classified in one of three levels: 1 (<b style="color:green">green</b>),
  2 (<b style="color:yellow">yellow</b>) and 3 (<b style="color:red">red</b>), being red the highest risk and green the lowest. This behavior is based on the premise that the higher the risk level, 
  the harder is to sucessfully perform a mitigation action in that zone (rescue, fire figthing, crisis control, etc).
